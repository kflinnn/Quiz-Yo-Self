# Quiz-Yo-Self

## Purpose

A quick, timed quiz on basic coding created with JavaScript.

When the user clicks the start button, they are presented with a question and the timer starts. When they answer the question, they are presented with another question. If they answer incorrectly, time is subtracted from the timer. The game is over when either all questions are answered or time has run out. The user is then able to save their initials and score to be a part of the High Score List. This was achieved in JavaScript using functions, conditional statements, event listeners, arrays, objects, and many other elements as well as styling through a CSS stylesheet.
